# React Application Bootstrapped with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), providing a powerful and flexible environment for building modern web applications with React and JavaScript.

---

## üì¶ Getting Started

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It bundles React in production mode and optimizes for best performance.\
[More on deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once ejected, you can‚Äôt go back!**\
It gives full control over configurations (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.).
